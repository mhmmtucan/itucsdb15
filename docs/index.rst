This project provides a API service for generating quotes. Quotes are limited by the number of quotes that are currently exists in database. 
API provides users two option; they can either send a keyword in order to take a quote generated with provided keyword or they can generate
quotes without sending any keywords. If users do not want to use API service they can generate quotes within the web application and use whereever
they like.

For more detailed description of API usage please look at the User Guide section.
